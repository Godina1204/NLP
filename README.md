# Tokenization Example
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install & Download Model

pip install spacy
python -m spacy download xx_ent_wiki_sm

input : ‚ÄúStudents often struggle with managing their time effectively. Sometimes, they procrastinate, which leads to stress. However, with practice, they can develop better habits.‚Äù

### üßÆ Example Run

```python

# input text
text = ‚ÄúStudents often struggle with managing their time effectively. Sometimes, they procrastinate, which leads to stress. However, with practice, they can develop better habits.‚Äù

# Manual tokenization (splitting by spaces)
manual_tokens = text.split()

# spaCy tokenization
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
doc = nlp(text)
spacy_tokens = [token.text for token in doc]

# Compare results
print("Original Text:\n", text, "\n")
print("Na√Øve space-based tokens:\n", naive_tokens, "\n")
print("Manual corrected tokens:\n", manual_tokens, "\n")
print("spaCy tokens:\n", spacy_tokens, "\n")
```

# BPE Learner

input : Machine learning models are transforming industries. Deep learning techniques enable computers to recognize patterns in images, text, and audio. Subword tokenization improves performance for rare and unseen words, making NLP applications more robust and efficient.

# Word pair

### üßÆ Example Run
```python
source = "Sunday"
target = "Saturday"

# Model A Equal cost for all operations
dist_a, dp_a = edit_distance(source, target, sub_cost=1, ins_cost=1, del_cost=1)
path_a = reconstruct_path(dp_a, source, target, sub_cost=1, ins_cost=1, del_cost=1)

# Model B Higher Cost for Substitution
dist_b, dp_b = edit_distance(source, target, sub_cost=2, ins_cost=1, del_cost=1)
path_b = reconstruct_path(dp_b, source, target, sub_cost=2, ins_cost=1, del_cost=1)
```
